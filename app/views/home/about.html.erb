    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>
      Doge is a social networking app built using Ruby on Rails. It's free &amp; completely open source. You can check the source on <a href="https://github.com/haitranviet96/doge-much-buddies"><%= fa_icon 'github' %> Github</a>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>
      We are not building the next Facebook. Given that there are enough social networks already we don't want to end up launching one. Pointless!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>How?</h3>
    <p>
      As stated above it's a Ruby on Rails application. Frontend is developed using Twitter Bootstrap. Database is SQLite for development and Postgresql for production.
